# Risk
This is for risk analysis and improvement points.
1. object Occlusion
    - by normal pedestrian
        - long term tracking
        - higher level feature
    - by other theft partner
        - optimize the balance between pose and stay time
        - set different level suspicion
2. upgrade pose classifier
    - with the online data being collected, we can have more and more data to update our pose classifier
    - change to supervised learning
3. update new functions
    - we can do more than thief detect
    - fall down detect, hurt detect, other crime detect, etc
4. realtime issue
    - now we highly rely on network, we need realtime streaming
    - update hardware to webcam+microcomputer
    - quantify and predict optimize
5. other models
    - gait recognition
    - human attributes(age, gender, nationality, etc)
